        Parameters
        ----------
        tokenizer : _Tokenizer
            A tokenizer instance from the abydos.tokenizer package
        intersection_type : str
            Specifies the intersection type, and set type as a result:

                - 'crisp': Ordinary intersection, wherein items are entirely
                  members or non-members of the intersection. (Default)
                - 'fuzzy': Fuzzy intersection, defined by :cite:`Wang:2014`,
                  wherein items can be partially members of the intersection
                  if their similarity meets or exceeds a threshold value. This
                  also takes `metric` (by default :class:`Levenshtein()`) and
                  `threshold` (by default 0.8) parameters.
                - 'soft': Soft intersection, defined by :cite:`Russ:2014`,
                  wherein items can be partially members of the intersection
                  depending on their similarity. This also takes a `metric`
                  (by default :class:`DamerauLevenshtein()`) parameter.
        **kwargs
            Arbitrary keyword arguments

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        qval : int
            The length of each q-gram. Using this parameter and tokenizer=None
            will cause the instance to use the QGram tokenizer with this
            q value.
        metric : _Distance
            A string distance measure class for use in the 'soft' and 'fuzzy'
            variants.
        threshold : float
            A threshold value, similarities above which are counted as
            members of the intersection for the 'fuzzy' variant.
