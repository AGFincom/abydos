    For two sets X and Y and a population N, the pattern difference
    :cite:`Batagelj:1995`, Batagelj & Bren's :math:`- bc -` is

        .. math::

            dist_{pattern}(X, Y) =
            \frac{4 \cdot |X \setminus Y| \cdot |Y \setminus X|}
            {|N|^2}

    In 2x2 matrix, a+b+c+d=n terms, this is

            \frac{4bc}{n^2}

    In :cite:`IBM:2017`, the formula omits the 4 in the numerator:
    :math:`\frac{bc}{n^2}.

        Parameters
        ----------
        alphabet : Counter, collection, int, or None
            This represents the alphabet of possible tokens.

                - If a Counter is supplied, it is used directly in computing
                  the complement of the tokens in both sets.
                - If a collection is supplied, it is converted to a Counter
                  and used directly. In the case of a single string being
                  supplied and the QGram tokenizer being used, the full
                  alphabet is inferred (i.e.
                  :math:`len(set(alphabet+QGrams.start_stop))^{QGrams.qval}` is
                  used as the cardinality of the full alphabet.
                - If an int is supplied, it is used as the cardinality of the
                  full alphabet.
                - If None is supplied, the cardinality of the full alphabet
                  is inferred if QGram tokenization is used (i.e.
                  :math:`28^{QGrams.qval}` is used as the cardinality of the
                  full alphabet or :math:`26` if QGrams.qval is 1, which
                  assumes the strings are English language strings). Otherwise,
                  The cardinality of the complement of the total will be 0.
        tokenizer : _Tokenizer
            A tokenizer instance from the abydos.tokenizer package
        intersection_type : str
            Specifies the intersection type, and set type as a result:

                - 'crisp': Ordinary intersection, wherein items are entirely
                  members or non-members of the intersection. (Default)
                - 'fuzzy': Fuzzy intersection, defined by :cite:`Wang:2014`,
                  wherein items can be partially members of the intersection
                  if their similarity meets or exceeds a threshold value. This
                  also takes `metric` (by default :class:`Levenshtein()`) and
                  `threshold` (by default 0.8) parameters.
                - 'soft': Soft intersection, defined by :cite:`Russ:2014`,
                  wherein items can be partially members of the intersection
                  depending on their similarity. This also takes a `metric`
                  (by default :class:`DamerauLevenshtein()`) parameter.
        **kwargs
            Arbitrary keyword arguments

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        qval : int
            The length of each q-gram. Using this parameter and tokenizer=None
            will cause the instance to use the QGram tokenizer with this
            q value.
        metric : _Distance
            A string distance measure class for use in the 'soft' and 'fuzzy'
            variants.
        threshold : float
            A threshold value, similarities above which are counted as
            members of the intersection for the 'fuzzy' variant.
