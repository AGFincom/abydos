    Description:
    (adapted from R documentation as this is ported directly from the R code)
    The result, say r, is r = x + numpy.random.uniform(-a, a) where n = len(x)
    and a is the amount argument (if specified).

    Let z = max(x) - min(x) (assuming the usual case). The amount a to be added
    is either provided as positive argument amount or otherwise computed from z,
    as follows:

    If amount == 0, we set a = factor * z/50 (same as S).

    If amount is None (default), we set a = factor * d/5 where d is the
    smallest difference between adjacent unique x values.
